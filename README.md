# Movie-Recommender_System
This repository contains the implementation of a Movie Recommender System using Python. The project demonstrates both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. Built using Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and PyCharm for production-ready code, this project serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and creating recommendation systems. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed using libraries like Pandas and NumPy, while machine learning algorithms from Scikit-Learn are used to compute recommendations. This repository is perfect for beginners looking to learn about recommender systems or developers seeking a foundational project to build upon.
